# Reader-Writer-Data-Synchronization
•	Built a multi-threaded data pipeline using POSIX threads and QNX synchronization APIs.
•	Designed writer threads to fetch and store data safely in a shared buffer.
•	Developed reader threads to process data with thread-safe access.
•	Optimized performance by minimizing CPU usage and avoiding polling.
